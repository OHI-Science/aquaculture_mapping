## Overview

There are 23 states with marine coasts.

**There is comprehensive downloadable data for 7 states: **

 - Maine, Alaska, New Hampshire, Connecticut, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Alabama
 

**There are publicly available map viewers (leases or farm locations) which seem to be comprehensive, but are NOT downloadable for 1 state:**

 - Virginia

**There is general info on lease holders, what they farm, and what municipality or city they are in for 6 states:** 

 - California: general areas with acreage for commercial farms
 - Oregon: map of places were commercial harvest/growing is allowed
 - New Jersey: Have pdf maps of all existing shellfish leases and those issued in 2020
 - Massachusetts: Have number of growers per municipality with acreage and species type; also a subset of farms are available in the NE data viewer.
 - South Carolina: Apparently have 9 oyster farms as of 2021
 - Washington: Approximate locations of commercial net pens. 
 
**Subset of farms or outdated downloadable for 2 states:**

 - Florida: A map of mariculture farms which are at risk of oil spills
 - Maryland: Have INDIVIDUAL pdf maps of all lease applications and if they were accepted or not... And was able to download lease data from 2013.
 
**Couldn't really find any information on 4 states:**

 - Hawaii, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi
 
**Probably no mariculture for 2 states:**

 - Delaware: Commercial harvest is illegal; apparently one farm but not production (Halley)
 - Georgia: From what I could tell, oyster farming was illegal here as recent as 2020
 - New York: No production (Halley) 

## Comprehensive, downloadable

### Maine

 - Viewer: https://www.maine.gov/dmr/aquaculture/leases/aquaculturemap.html
 - Download: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::mainedmr-aquaculture-aq-leases/about
 - I think we will want to use regular leases only.
 - Limited purpose leases are for scientific or smaller/shorter term mariculture projects, that last up to 3 years.
 - I think this can be considered "comprehensive". 
 - Update to date as of 2019.
 - Has species types specified.

### Alaska 

 - https://adfg.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f3ca95493c1042b39e42a3ecb5dcad6a
 - Will be considered "comprehensive". 
 - Up-to-date as of 2020
 - Specifies species type
 - Csvs with lat lons, but have a "corner" dataset, which we could make into polygons. Has area associated with each site. 
 - Shown in red. 
 - Has 62 active sites. 
 
```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(usmap)

alaska_details <- read.csv(file.path("/home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/_raw_data/Aquaculture_locations/USA/Alaska/Active Aquatic Farming Operation Details.csv"))

alaska_corners <- read.csv(file.path("/home/shares/food-systems/Food_footprint/_raw_data/Aquaculture_locations/USA/Alaska/Active Aquatic Farming Operation Corners.csv")) ## each group of corners is a polygon representing one farming operation. So, we will need to somehow make those polygons and find the centroid of each group to get points. Save as polygons and as points if possible? Maybe don't even need the exact polygons, since we know the area of each. Almost all are active. 

library(tigris)

ak <- counties("Alaska", cb = TRUE) %>%
  filter(NAME %in% c("Aleutians East", "Lake and Peninsula", "Bristol Bay", "Kodiak Island", "Kenai Peninsula", "Anchorage", "Yakutat", "Hoonah-Angoon", "Haines", "Sitka", "Juneau", "Prince of Wales-Hyder", "Ketchikan Gateway", "Wrangell", "Petersburg", "Valdez-Cordova"))

### New Hampshire

 - https://granit.unh.edu/data/search

### Connecticut 

 

From the Northeast ocean council dataset: 

"Connecticut – Data on Connecticut aquaculture was derived from two datasets provided by the State of Connecticut Department of Agriculture/Bureau of Aquaculture and the State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. One dataset contains the location of natural shellfish beds. Natural beds managed by the state, town or used for recreational harvesting were selected from this dataset, resulting in 1855 polygons. The number of beds in use at any given time is subject to change. The second dataset contains 46 polygons representing the approximate geographical location of permitted “Certificate for Aquaculture  Operation” gear sites in the Connecticut coastal waters of Long Island Sound via the State of Connecticut Application for Joint Programmatic General Permit for Aquaculture Department of the Army General Permit. These datasets are up to date as of January 15, 2016. For more information on CT Aquaculture and Shellfish, see the CT Aquaculture Mapping Atlas."


Map combined with NY, this is what we need (seaweed and shellfish). We will extract the data using the methods described below: https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f8799cefbb4c4751a209710d14b9ad46

Current as of 2019

### Alabama

 - "Alabama has an emerging oyster industry with 13 farms comprising of 25 acres in 2015. Shellfish farms are a source of healthy protein and can contribute to healthy marine ecosystems by cleaning the water column, providing habitat for other sea life, and helping protect shorelines from storm surges and sea level rise." from https://aop.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=e97ddd2cd9cf46218cefeed813e26c87

## Maps with no download


### Virginia

Shellfish

 - https://mrc.virginia.gov/links.shtm
 - They have oyster lease and application data, which *I think* is the only type of aquaculture there. The map isn't downloadable from what I can tell though, so I bet we will have to email to access.
 - They also have a phone app.
 - web.info@mrc.virginia.gov

### Washington

Approved growing areas map

 - https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/oswpviewer/index.html
 
 
"DNR leases deep water sites for finfish net pens and floating shellfish rafts and longlines. Salmon aquaculture operations have existed in Washington since the 1970s and are scattered throughout Puget Sound. Current net pen leases include salmon aquaculture, delayed-release salmon, and herring. The use of floating shellfish culture began in 1975 with mussel raft culture in Penn Cove. Current floating shellfish culture on rafts or longlines include oysters, mussels, and scallops."

Other than the above, I can't find much info for Florida. Google maps shows a couple shrimp farms. 


### Maryland

Shellfish

 - They have individual lease application maps in PDFs, but they would take forever to go through. They must have some sort of internal dataset where they store the approved lease info?: https://dnr.maryland.gov/fisheries/pages/aquaculture/applications.aspx
 - Maude Morris: maudee.morris@maryland.gov

![](/home/sgclawson/github/aquaculture_mapping/marine/united_states/pics/maryland_apps.png)

List of farms for VA and MD (addresses are on land though): https://oysterrecovery.org/oyster-farms/


Maryland has a viewer for 2013 active leases: https://maryland.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f7db2acc81554601b44c13733a66a60f
 
 - This viewer has a layer named "ActiveOysterLeases", however, it looks like the last time it was updated is 2013.. I will still download this. Worst case we use this. 

I found the layer here: https://gisapps.dnr.state.md.us/arcgis2/rest/services/Biota/ActiveOysterLeases/MapServer/0

Run query using that link to output json (for some reason it won't let me output geojson): https://gisapps.dnr.state.md.us/arcgis2/rest/services/Biota/ActiveOysterLeases/MapServer/0/query?where=0%3D0&outFields=%2A&f=json

 - Pretty much all freshwater from what I can tell. 
 
 
### Texas

 - https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2020/05/21/texas-says-shucks-lets-give-oyster-growing-a-try
 - Seems like a very new industry in Texas. 
 
 - Seafood watch 
https://www.seafoodwatch.org/-/m/sfw/pdf/reports/s/mba_seafoodwatch_usfarmedshrimpreport.pdf
 - "Most commercial shrimp aquaculture production in the US is located in Texas, which has seven commercial farms."
 
http://www.texasaquaculture.org/TxShrimpFms.html
 - They have 9 Texas locations listed here. One is definitely freshwater prawns. Unclear if they are land-based or not (I guess all shrimp farms are techincally land-based since they are ponds). Need to explore these more. 
 - These are current as of 2018.

### Hawaii 

https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/ai/aquaculture-and-livestock-support-services-branch/aquaculture-in-hawaii/

 - Not much info. There is definitely both offshore aquaculture and shrimp aquaculture in Hawaii. 


 
## No mariculture? 

### Delaware

"Delaware is the only coastal state with no commercial shellfish aquaculture; a multimillion dollar business in our neighboring states up and down the East Coast."

 - Don't have to worry about Delaware. 


### Georgia

 - https://www.gpb.org/news/2020/11/09/will-georgias-fledgling-oyster-industry-sink-it-swims
 - Highly unlikely there are any marine farms here. I think marine aquaculture might be illegal here? And even if it wasn't, they most likely haven't even had a harvest since it was legalized (see above article).
 

### New York
 
 - According to Halley, there is currently no production in New York state, especially since their coastline is so small. 



## Species/production breakdown for US

Take a look at the species in the US that FAO reports

 
```{r, message=FALSE}
fao_data_all <- read_csv("../../data/fao_aquaculture_clean.csv")

fao_data_us <- fao_data_all %>%
  filter(iso3c == "USA")


fao_data_us_group <- fao_data_us %>%
  filter(year == 2018)

marine <- fao_data_us_group %>%
  filter(environment == "Marine") %>%
  filter(!is.na(value))

# unique(marine$species)

# 16 marine spp
#  [1] "Atlantic salmon"             "Blue mussel"                 "Northern quahog(=Hard clam)"
#  [4] "Sand gaper"                  "American cupped oyster"      "Red drum"                   
#  [7] "Whiteleg shrimp"             "Longfin yellowtail"          "Abalones nei"               
# [10] "Butter clam"                 "Cupped oysters nei"          "Japanese carpet shell"      
# [13] "Marine fishes nei"           "Pacific cupped oyster"       "Pacific geoduck"            
# [16] "Pacific littleneck clam"   

## there were 4 species with NA production (so actually 20 marine species total)
marine_na <- fao_data_us_group %>%
  filter(environment == "Marine") %>%
  filter(is.na(value))
#unique(marine_na$species)
# [1] "Cockles nei"          "European flat oyster" "Olympia oyster"       "Pacific horse clam"  

# sum(marine$value, na.rm = TRUE) 

# 203687 total tonnes for marine.. does this seem correct? 
```

FAO reports 16 different marine species of production in 2018. Additionally, there were 4 species that were previously harvested but had no harvest for 2018. FAO reports a total of 203687 live weight tonnes for 2018. 

NOAA Fisheries of the United States 2019 Report: 
https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2021-05/FUS2019-FINAL-webready-2.3.pdf?null=

 - NOAA report 44094 metric tonnes of marine aquaculture production for 2018... versus 203687 from FAO. I think this has to do with NOAA reporting meat weight and FAO reporting live weight (includes shells)
 - NOAA also reports that the Gulf region produces th e most marine aquaculture by volume.. which seems problematic for us considering we have very poor farm level data for the Gulf states.

2018 Census of Aquaculture: https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Aquaculture/Aqua.pdf
 
 - Table 1 shows aquaculture farms per state, but it is not split between marine and freshwater from what I can tell. Also split by species group (mollusk, crustaceans, etc.)
 - Table 10 shows saltwater acres and number of farms used for aquaculture production. However, there are landlocked states, so we don't know if it is actually marine or on-land saltwater aquaculture. It does seem reasonable that this would be pretty close to the actual number of farms.. 
 - Table 11 shows sources of water, with "Saltwater" included. This is just where the water comes from. 
 - Table 12 mollusks off bottom seems reasonable to think most of these will be in marine environments. Almost all of the states listed are coastal states. 

 - It seems like "Mollusks off bottom", "Mollusks on bottom", "Sea vegetables" are the only ones that I am 80% sure are marine farms... 
 - They also have data at the county level. I know this wouldn't be perfect, but we could filter for coastal counties.
