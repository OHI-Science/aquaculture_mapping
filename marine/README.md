This series of folders/scripts preps the aquaculture layers. 

To start, you should complete "STEP1_species_groups" first.

After that, the order of the folders do not matter, however within each folder, you will need to start with the "species_farms" folder. The farms folder has a series of scripts which places aquaculture farms for each species group. 

I completed the species folders in the following order: 

 - salmon
   - salmon_farm
   - salmon_ghg
   - salmon_disturbance
   - salmon_nutrient
   - salmon_water
 - shrimp 
   - shrimp_farm
   - shrimp_ghg
   - shrimp_disturbance
   - shrimp_nutrient
   - shrimp_water
 - bivalve
   - bivalve_farm
   - bivalve_ghg
   - bivalve_disturbance
   - bivalve_nutrient
   - bivalve_water
 - marine_fish_general
   - finfish_farm
   - finfish_ghg
   - finfish_disturbance
   - finfish_nutrient
   - finfish_water
 - tuna
   - tuna_farm
   - tuna_ghg
   - tuna_disturbance
   - tuna_nutrient
   - tuna_water
 - crustaceans
   - crustacean_farm
   - crustacean_ghg
   - crustacean_disturbance
   - crustacean_nutrient
   - crustacean_water
 
 
 Good luck!
