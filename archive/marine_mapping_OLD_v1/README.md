This series of folders/scripts preps the aquaculture layers. 

To start, you should complete "STEP1_species_groups" first.

After that, the order of the folders do not matter, however within each folder, you will need to start with the "species_farms" folder. The farms folder has a series of scripts which places aquaculture farms for each species group. The other folder in each species folder is labelled "food_pressures", and contain the data prep for calculating global food pressures associated with each farm type (this was used for the global food systems project). 

I completed the species folders in the following order: 

 - salmon
   - salmon_farm
 
 - shrimp 
   - shrimp_farm

 - bivalve
   - bivalve_farm

 - marine_fish_general
   - finfish_farm

 - tuna
   - tuna_farm

 - crustaceans
   - crustacean_farm
 
 After completing the farm folders, you can calculate the food pressures by navigating to the "food_pressures" folder within each species grouping. 
 
 Good luck!
